The World Wide Web and HTML may have been invented by Tim Berners Lee (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1999, p. 29), but it was based on an old version of [SGML](SGML.html) used at CERN (Palmer, 2000). Apart from the addition of the anchor `<a>` [tag](tag.html) in HTML, most of the structure of HTML was taken ultimately from the [GML](GML.html) 'Starter' tag set (GML, 1991).
