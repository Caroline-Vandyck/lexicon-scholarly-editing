The integral apparatus is a mode of [text](text.html) presentation incorporating variance into the invariant context. Conceptually, the idea of the integral apparatus--whatever its actual design--has gone beyond the notion of the [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) as a textual and typographical adjunct to the [edited text](textEdited.html) of a [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html). Instead, the integral apparatus is, or represents, the text itself as multilayered, multiple factored, and multiply generated. It is the text that literary theory today recognizes as emminating from [authorial](authorial.html) writing and from socially and culturally conditioned [transmission](textualTransmission.html).
