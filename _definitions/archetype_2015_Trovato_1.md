Henceforth I shall use archetype1 in the first, i.e., the most widespread, of those ancient and Humanist meanings, that is, in the sense of  “official [text](text.html), prepared by its [author](author.html) for publication” […].
Thus, by further refinements, scholars evolved increasingly rigorous formulations, such as “a lost copy marred by at least one [error of the conjunctive type](errorConjunctive.html), from which the whole tradition derives”.
In this second meaning, the archetype (archetype2) can be reconstructed logically – with varying degrees of accuracy – on the basis of the number of conjunctive errors that are common to all its descendants.
