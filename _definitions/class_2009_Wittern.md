In order to organize the more than 500 [elements](element.html) used in the [TEI](TEI.html) [schema](schema.html) into a comprehensible system, but also to group them together by similarity of semantics, structure, or location and make modification and customization possible, most TEI elements are defined through classes rather than directly. [Attributes](attribute.html) commonly used together are also grouped into classes. Classes can contain other classes. Elements inherit the properties of the classes of which they are members.
