More usually however, the [transcribers](transcription.html) and creators of electronic [texts](text.html) wish to control how [elements](element.html) can meaningfully appear within a given [class](class.html) of texts, so that processors intended to act on them can do so more intelligently. The specification of what is legal within any one kind of textual component or element is known in [SGML](SGML.html) as its content model, because it provides a model for its content.
