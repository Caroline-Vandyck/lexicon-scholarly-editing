When, in his edition of Nashe, McKerrow invented the term 'copy-text', he was merely giving a name to a conception already familiar, and he used it in a general sense to indicate that early [text](text.html) of a [work](work.html) which an [editor](editorScholarly.html) selected as the basis of his own. Later, as we shall see, he gave it a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is this change in conception I wish to consider.
