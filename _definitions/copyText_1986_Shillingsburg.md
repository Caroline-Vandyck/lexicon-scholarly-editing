copy-text--the [text](text.html) that is the basis for the [edited text](textEdited.html). Copy-text [readings](reading.html) are adopted by the [editor](editorScholarly.html) unless some cause exists to change them--in which case the editor [emends](textEmended.html). The copy-text is usually the text found in one [document](document.html), but that is not always the case.
