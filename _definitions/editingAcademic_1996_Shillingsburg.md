_academic editing_ (this for a lack of a better distinguising name, or perhaps for lack of a more distinguished name) is the term I use for the work of an "[editor](editor.html)" asked by a publisher to write an introduction for a reprint, said editor not necessarily taking part in the selection, correction, or [proofreading](proofsPage.html) of the new "edition".
