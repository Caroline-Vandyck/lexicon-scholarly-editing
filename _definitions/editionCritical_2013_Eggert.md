This is the reason for the term “critical” edition. […] The business of determining what the [author](author.html) intended is inevitably a critical act, though in a critical edition its subjectivity is traditionally hedged in at every point by whatever can be ascertained or inferred about the history of the [work](work.html)’s writing and early production.
