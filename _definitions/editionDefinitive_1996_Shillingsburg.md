**definitive edition.** A descriptive term that reached prominence in the 1970s to replace [definitive text](textDefinitive.html). It was meant that, taken as a whole--[text](text.html) and [apparatus](apparatus.html)--a [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html) could represent [definitive](definitive.html) research that would never have to be done again, though the text itself might be re-edited according to differing [principles](editorialPrinciples.html).
