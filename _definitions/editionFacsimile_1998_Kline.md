[Facsimile](facsimile.html) edition. An [edition](editionScholarly.html) that aims at reproducing precisely all of the details of the [source text](textSource.html). This may be in the form of a duplicate image (photographic, microform, or digitally scanned), or, rarely, a [typographic facsimile](facsimileTypographic.html).
