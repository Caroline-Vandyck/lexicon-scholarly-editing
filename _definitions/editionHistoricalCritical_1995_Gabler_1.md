The aim of a German edition is not to establish a [text](text.html) in the sense of critically shaping it. An [edition](editionScholarly.html) provides as its [edited text](textEdited.html), rather, a [segment](segment.html) or slice from the text's [history](history.html). In practical terms, an edition commonly prints, or reprints, an historically defined [version](version.html) of the [work](work.html) as edited text. Around and toward it, the edition organizes the entire textual history in [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) form. License to modify the edited text is restricted to an absolute minimum, [emendation](emendation.html) functioning exclusively to remove the textual error, or '[textual fault](textualFault.html)' (_Textfehler_), with debates of definition over what should be allowed as _Textfehler_.
