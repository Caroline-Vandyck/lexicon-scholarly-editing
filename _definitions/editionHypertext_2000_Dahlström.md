if "[hypertext](hypertext.html) edition of a classical [work](work.html)" simply means a [digitised](digitization.html) [text](text.html) [version](version.html) supplied with a few relevant external hyperlinks, then there can be no telling how many hypertext editions are currently out there online. But if we by hypertext edition mean a [digital edition](editionDigital.html), composed for scholarly uses and needs, of a particular classical [work](work.html), presenting some or all of the differing textual versions of the work and interconnecting them using hypertextual links, then the supply is scarce.
