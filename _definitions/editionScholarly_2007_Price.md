By scholarly edition, I mean the establishment of a [text](text.html) on explicitly stated principles and by someone with specialized knowledge about [textual scholarship](textualScholarship.html) and the [writer](writer.html) or writers involved. An edition is scholarly both because of the rigor with which the text is reproduced or altered and because of the expertise brought to bear on the task and in the offering of suitable introductions, notes, and textual [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html). Mere [digitizing](digitization.html) produces information; in contrast, [scholarly editing](editingScholarly.html) produces knowledge.
