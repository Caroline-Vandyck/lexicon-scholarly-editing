Recently, for [modern manuscripts](manuscriptModern.html) (especially [draft](draft.html) [manuscripts](manuscript.html)) a new form of [diplomatic edition](editionDiplomatic.html) has been developed which attempts to reproduce also the topographic collocation of different writings, including functional signs and marks, again within the limits of the print medium. This new type of edition is called super-diplomatic or type-[facsimile](facsimile.html).
