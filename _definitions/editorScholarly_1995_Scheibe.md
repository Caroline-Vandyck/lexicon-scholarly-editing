An editor's capability manifests itself in the ability (which is also a duty) to envisage a [manuscript](manuscript.html) covered with [corrections](correction.html) in its pristine condition, as a blank [sheet](sheet.html) of [paper](paper.html), in order to recognize and establish as far as possible how this sheet was, step  by step, covered with letters and symbols, with "[text](text.html)," and how and why some parts of this text changed and others remained constant. The editor must therefore see the concrete development [process](writingProcess.html)--that is, be able to retrace and comprehend it; the editor must also interpret it--that is, be able to describe and present it.
