By _editor_ I mean anyone - friends, family, professional and [scholarly editors](editorScholarly.html), publishers, even adapters - who in the course of the [history](history.html) of a given [work](work.html) lay hands upon that [text](text.html) to shape it in new ways. By making this extension into what is now referred to as the [social text](textSocial.html), I do not want to diminish the exciting creative impulses of the individual writers as manifest in their [manuscripts](manuscript.html) or [authorized](authorization.html) print-text revisions; I simply want to expand the horizon of creativity, normally a preserve for the [writers](writer.html) who originate literary works, to include those readers who also materially alter texts.
