The historian of science Alexandre Koyr√© described the transformation that occurred in the move from a pre-Copernican image of a closed world to that of an infinite universe. Genetic criticism corresponds to a trend that is in many ways similar. In the past, editors aimed to establish a [text](text.html) in what they hoped would be a [definite edition](editionDefinitive.html); genetic critics have put the text back into motion, opening it to the moving constellations that presided at its [genesis](genesis.html). The textual _ne varietur_ has been shaken up by an _e pur si muove_.
