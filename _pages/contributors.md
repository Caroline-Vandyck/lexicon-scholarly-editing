# Credits

In the first place, the credits for this Lexicon of course go to the authors, for writing the definitions in the first place. These authors and their publications can be found on our [Bibliography](bibliography.html) page. We try to follow the [fair-use policy](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/17/1/107) when quoting their publications. Nevertheless, if you find we have quoted one of your publications too extensively, please do not hesitate to [contact](mailto:wout.dillen@uantwerpen.be) us.

## Concept
The idea to create a Lexicon of Scholarly Editing emerged from the [2009 edition](http://www.geneticjoycestudies.org/ESTS2009/) of the annual [ESTS](http://www.textualscholarship.eu/) conference that took place in Brussels, Belgium. In 2012, [Dirk Van Hulle](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/dirk-vanhulle/) (professor at the [University of Antwerp](http://www.uantwerpen.be/), and former president of ESTS) discussed the possibility of building an online Lexicon with [Wout Dillen](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/wout-dillen/), one of his PhD students at the [Centre for Manuscript Genetics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/rg/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/) (University of Antwerp). During these discussions, it was decided that Wout would build a **Lexicon** as part of his work on the [ERC](http://erc.europa.eu/) project ‘Creative Undoing and Textual Scholarship (CUTS),’ that is supervised by Dirk Van Hulle.

We are very grateful for every single contribution, and hope they will inspire others to contribute to the Lexicon as well.

## Special Thanks
We would also like to thank [Catherine Nygren](https://twitter.com/broomgrass) and [Neil Fraistat](https://twitter.com/fraistat) for contributing to the Lexicon by finding a source for Fraistat’s definition of ‘contexture‘; Elli Bleeker for suggesting sources for [the Lexicon’s To-Do-List](https://www.zotero.org/groups/lexicon_of_scholarly_editing) and for pointing out a definition for ‘edition (critical)‘ I had overlooked in D’Iorio 2010; Vivien Friedrich (Arthur Schnitzler digital) for pointing me in the direction of Bodo Plachta’s Editionswissenschaft and for her help translating some of its concepts into English; [Sakari Katajamäki](http://www.finlit.fi/fi/tutkimus/loyda-asiantuntija/sakari-katajamaki#.VCrAsil_s7g) of the [Finnish Literature Society](http://neba.finlit.fi/index.php?lang=eng) in Helsinki for directing me to his and Karina Lukin’s paper that included a useful definition for ‘textual scholarship‘; and Paulius Subačius for pointing out an error in a definition of textual scholar. Thanks also to Sakari, [Annika Rockenberger](https://twitter.com/ARockenberger), and [Georg Vogeler](https://twitter.com/i/notifications) for suggesting more useful links for the [About](https://twitter.com/i/notifications) page.

## Website Development
The website was originally developed by Wout Dillen with WordPress, using plugins such as [Encyclopedia Pro](http://dennishoppe.de/wordpress-plugins/encyclopedia). A first, local demo version was presented at [the 2012 edition of the ESTS conference](http://ests2012.huygens.knaw.nl/) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. On 19 November 2013, a beta version of the Lexicon was published online, right before the [2013 edition](http://www.textualscholarship.eu/conference-2013.html) of the ESTS conference in Paris, France. In 2020, the Lexicon was redeveloped by Wout Dillen as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and deposited in the [Zenodo Open Science Repository](https://zenodo.org/) to make it more sustainable, more citable, to improve collaboration, crediting, and versioning options, and to allow for more automation while also publishing the definitions as a dataset. As part of his internship, Jesse was a great help in migrating the Lexicon to its new environment.
