        <p>Like “<a href="entity.html">entity</a>”, the word “attribute” has a specific technical sense when used in the <a href="SGML.html">SGML</a> context, which differs somewhat from its sense when used in the database design context. An SGML attribute is a category of information associated with a particular type of <a href="element.html">element</a>, but not contained within it. Attributes are associated with particular element occurrences by including their name and value within the start-<a href="tag.html">tag</a> for the element concerned. For example:</p>

<p>Call me <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;name type="Biblical"&gt;</code>Ishmael<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Here “type” is the name of an attribute associated with any occurrence of the <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;name&gt;</code></strong> element, “Biblical” is the value defined for this attribute in the case of the example <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;name&gt;</code></strong> above.</p>

<p>Attributes are used for two related purposes: they enable an identifying number or name to be associated with a particular element occurrence within a <a href="text.html">text</a> (which might otherwise be missing), and they enable additional information missing from a text to be added to it without violating its integrity.</p>
