<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                --_Provisional_ avant-texte _stage_: before any verifiable appearance of the compositional project, this process transforms the collection of sources at the [author](author.html)'s disposal in his or her own [manuscripts](manuscript.html) and [work](work.html) notes, into a pending structure potentially oriented toward this project.
                --_Exploratory_ avant-texte _stage_: before any verifiable decision made to undertake the compositional project, this process constitutes, for the [writer](writer.html), an informal exploration of possible ideas, during the course of which a compositional preproject takes shape.                
                --_Preparatory_ avant-texte _stage_: the initial process by which the project proper takes shape, a decision-making process, but also one of conception and in certain cases, of planning.          
                --_Structuring at_ avant-texte _stage_: the processes by which the conception and initial planning of the project are reworked in a compositional framework, in terms of overarching and partial structuring.                
                --_Research at_ avant-texte _stage_: the processes by which the writer, in certain cases, finds it necessary to equip him- or herself with further documentation, in greater or lesser quantities, to sift and transform it for integration into the composition.                
                --_Composition at_ avant-texte _stage_: the processes by which the composition proper is performed, through the succession of rough [drafts](draft.html) to the [definitive manuscript](manuscriptFinal.html).                
                --_Postcompositional_ avant-texte _stage_: the process of definitive rewriting and checking performed, after the composition proper, on a [fair copy](fairCopy.html) of the definitive manuscript, then on the [proofs](proofs.html) that will be used in publishing the text. The final handwritten changes are recorded on the set of typed-up proofs bearing the writer's signature under the pronouncement "[bon a tirer](bonÀTirer.html)"
