The first word posed few problems; one could easily restrict its meaning to the tangible media of the writing process, those objects destined to be preserved by the generosity of authors and the admiration of lovers of belles-lettres.

Rough drafts would then include the following: 1) everything that had ever played a part in the composition of a work but had not attained publishable status: the preliminary dossier, the worksheets, and the portfolio of accessory notes; (2) the drafts properly so called, that is, the first draft and its metamorphoses (additions, corrections, erasures, and substitutions) up to the final state of first publication.
