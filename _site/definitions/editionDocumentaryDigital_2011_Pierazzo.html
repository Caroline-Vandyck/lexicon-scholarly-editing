        <p>Perhaps we should just stop trying to map <a href="editionDigital.html">digital editions</a> to printed ones and instead recognize that we are producing a different type of object, one that we can perhaps call a <em>documentary digital edition</em>. This new object necessarily comprises all three components of a digital publication–the <a href="textSource.html">source</a>, the output, and the tools to produce and display it–and it is worth emphasizing again that all three are scholarly products that result from editorial practice.</p>

<p>[…] From the discussion it follows that we could define this new type of editorial object the <em>documentary digital edition</em>, as the recording of as many features of the original <a href="document.html">document</a> as are considered meaningful by the <a href="editorScholarly.html">editors</a>, displayed in all the ways the editors consider useful for the readers, including all the tools necessary to achieve such a purpose.</p>
