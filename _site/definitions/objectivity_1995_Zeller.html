The subjective nature of editing shows itself in an extreme example such as the multiple textual forms given to the drafts of Hölderlin’s ‘Friedensfeier’ by various researchers; mere reference to previous editor’s misreadings of Hölderlin’s manuscripts exposed by Friedrich Beißner reminds us that the editor inevitably interprets, even during the process of deciphering manuscripts.

In spite of this, the texts of scholarly editions are largely understood and treated as if they were objective givens.
