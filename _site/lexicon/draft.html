		<p><strong>Brouillon(s):</strong> l’ensemble des <a href="writingProduct.html">écrits</a> rédigés ‘en vue de’ l’<a href="work.html">ouvrage</a> publié et qui conduisent à lui; la forme achevée en est le <a href="manuscript.html">manuscrit</a>.

		<p>A draft is a preliminary form of a <a href="version.html">version</a>. Composition is often complex, sometimes tortured. Incomplete forms are often essayed by <a href="author.html">authors</a> pursuing a coherent intention. Drafts of sentences, paragraphs, or scenes may be produced that cannot be thought of as belonging to completed versions of the <a href="work.html">work</a>. Yet both critic and <a href="editorScholarly.html">editor</a> may well gather insight into the meaning or function of a version from acquaintance with false starts or experimental forms. Determining when a <a href="variant.html">variant</a> in a <a href="text.html">text</a> is part of a draft and when it represents part of a new version may be difficult, but it is important to try to make that distinction, since one’s response to change may depend on whether it was produced by the same <a href="intentionality.html">intentionality</a> that produced its alternate form or whether sufficient time had passed to see the change as the product of a new effort. Drafts have the same ontological status as versions; they have no material existence. They are represented more or less well by the <a href="manuscript.html">manuscripts</a> containing them, but texts of drafts are also capable of misrepresenting the draft intention.</p>

		<p>According to the usual definition, a rough draft [<em>brouillon</em>] designates, very broadly, a <a href="manuscriptWorking.html">working manuscript</a> written with the <a href="intentionality.html">intention</a> of <a href="correction.html">correcting</a> it for use in the composition or final polishing of a <a href="text.html">text</a>. To take only its literary sense, this definition has the advantage of having a wide application and, to make up for it, the defect, under such loose specifications, of a reduced intelligibility. This explains why the word is frequently used and why a certain embarrassment often accompanies this use for philologists and literary historians enamored of terminological rigor. The difficulty is all the more palpable in that a new breed of researchers–<a href="criticGenetic.html">specialists in literary genetics</a>–have recently brought the rough draft to center stage by emphasizing the remarkable benefit that the critical study of texts could derive by recourse to these genetic <a href="document.html">documents</a>, in which the work of art becomes interpretable through the very movement that gave birth to it.</p>

		<p>The result of all this is that the meaning of the word ‘draft’ today has a broad margin of uncertainty. For the textual critic, concerned neither with <a href="manuscript.html">manuscript</a> nor with <a href="genesis.html">genetic</a> development, the word continues to mean, according to its usual definition, a vague generic term designating the approximate and negligible domain of all that precedes the finished <a href="version.html">version</a> of the <a href="text.html">text</a>: a sort of opaque space in which the structures of signification and style are not yet in place and that remains resistant to interpretative designs upon it. For the <a href="criticGenetic.html">literary genticist</a>, on the contrary, whose time is devoted to understanding the pre-textual process, the rough draft is an essential link in the chain of transformations that have led from the project of the <a href="work.html">work</a> to its <a href="textDefinitive.html">definitive text</a>: a crucial moment in the <a href="avantTexteStage">avant-texte stage</a>.</p>

		<p>When chance first presented me with an opportunity to study the <a href="document.html">documents</a> of a writer’s composition, I was embarrassed by a terminological difficulty. The French language gave me a choice between two words to designate these documents: <a href="manuscript">le manuscrit [the manuscript]</a>, quite literally the <a href="sheet.html">sheets</a> of <a href="paper.html">paper</a> covered with signs <a href="trace.html">traced</a> by the hand of the <a href="writer.html">writer</a>, and <em>les brouillons</em> [the rough drafts], that is, the materializations of an unfinished, prospective discourse, sometimes rejected but more often transformed through a process of development. The first word posed few problems; one could easily restrict its meaning to the tangible media of the <a href="writingProcess.html">writing process</a>, those objects destined to be preserved by the generosity of authors and the admiration of lovers of belles-lettres. One could use the second term, it seemed to me, to qualify what was <a href="writingProduct.html">written</a> on the manuscripts. <em>Rough drafts</em> would then include the following: 1) everything that had ever played a part in the composition of a work but had not attained publishable status: the preliminary <a href="geneticDossier.html">dossier</a>, the worksheets, and the portfolio of accessory notes; (2) the drafts properly so called, that is, the first draft and its metamorphoses (<a href="addition.html">additions</a>, <a href="correction.html">corrections</a>, <a href="deletion.html">erasures</a>, and <a href="substitution.html">substitutions</a>) up to the final state of first publication. This last state could again be transformed by print modifications, called <a href="variant">“variants” [variantes]</a>. [However, when I] considered the semantic and historical weight of of those two words “rough draft”–the ways they were historically and ideologically charged–it caused me to coin the term “<a href="avantTexte">avant-texte</a>” as a substitute.</p>
