		<p><strong>Scholarly edition.</strong> An edition with <a href="text.html">texts</a> established and verified according to the standards of the academic community. Such editions are also often referred to as <a href="authoritative.html">authoritative</a>.</p>

		<p>By scholarly edition, I mean the establishment of a <a href="text.html">text</a> on explicitly stated principles and by someone with specialized knowledge about <a href="textualScholarship.html">textual scholarship</a> and the <a href="writer.html">writer</a> or writers involved. An edition is scholarly both because of the rigor with which the text is reproduced or altered and because of the expertise brought to bear on the task and in the offering of suitable introductions, notes, and textual <a href="apparatusCritical.html">apparatus</a>. Mere <a href="digitization.html">digitizing</a> produces information; in contrast, <a href="editingScholarly.html">scholarly editing</a> produces knowledge.</p>

		<p>In general outline, a scholarly edition is the presentation of a <a href="text.html">text</a> – literary, historical, philosophical, juridical – or of a <a href="work.html">work</a> (mainly, a work of literature) in its often enough several texts, through the agency of an <a href="editorScholarly.html">editor</a> <em>in lieu</em> of the <a href="author.html">author</a> of the text, or work. We see the editor as ‘agency’, functionary and guardian of the lifeline between work (or text) and author.[…] The base line of my understanding of the scholarly edition is that it is a web of discourses. These discourses are interrelated and of equal standing. They are constituted, as discourses, by the editor, or team of editors, who provide as well as guarantee the edition’s coherence and intellectual focus. With their name or names, too, the editor or editors publicly assume responsibility for the construct of the edition as a whole.</p>

<p>Not an overly spectacular definition, perhaps. Yet looked at closely, it may be seen to turn the traditional sense of editions on its head by making not author and text, but the editor pivotal to an edition.</p>

		<p>A scholarly edition is an information resource which offers a critical representation of (normally) historical <a href="document.html">documents</a> or <a href="text.html">texts</a>.</p>
