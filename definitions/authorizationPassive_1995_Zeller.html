Within a witness document itself the proximity to the author may vary, with textual corruption arising from the momentary inattention of the author, the scribe, the compositor, or all these together. By our definition, even the deviations of an authorized printing from the setting copy that go unnoticed by the author are considered authorized. This merely formal, all-inclusive authorization has been called ‘passive authorization’ (in contrast to the ‘active’ variety of the author’s express approval)–an expression that temporarily aids understanding, but that is not a relevant differentiation for editorial practice.
