  <p>the value of the prefix “avant” (“pre”) does need a few words of clarification.

<p>Let us examine this. I am calling “avant-texte” the totality of the material written for any project that was first made public in a specific form. Since the term “textual” designates the closed field where a reading meets a writing so as to make the latter signify its unexpected and unpredictable possibilities, regardless of the <a href="author.html">author</a>’s <a href="intentionality.html">intentions</a> and the pressure of social and biographical <a href="history.html">history</a>, I will say that to attend to an avant-textual document is to read, continuously with the text and without any presuppositions, the totality of formulations that, as previous possibilities, have become part of a given <a href="work.html">work</a> of writing.</p>
